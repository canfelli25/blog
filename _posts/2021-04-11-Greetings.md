This is an initial post which hopefully starts many more fun posts about my side projects. Lately I've been driven to do lots of interesting things. I even bought myself an arduino uno!

I've been planning to do a blog about tech since I was in college but like many of 'side project', the idea just simply fanished because my lack of motivation. However, I think now is a good time to start since documenting while learning new fun things will elevate the joy. So here's to doing fun things in the future!
